# Black Hole
A black hole game. Use lasers and openings to maintain your core. In case of core collapse, escape rockets have been provided. In case of freezedown or meltdown, bunkers have been provided. In case of overload or ailen invasion, helicopters have been provided.
Overload:
  The openings maintain power generation. If the power ever hits 0, the overload happens. Evacuate to the helipad, and escape. Or don't. The music is cool. The more openings, the more power.
Freezedown:
  Heating and cooling lasers maintain core temp. If the core temp ever hits 0, the freezedown hapens. Go to the bunker to evacuate. The music is really cool if you let it play.
Meltdown:
   Heating and cooling lasers maintain core temp. If the core temp ever hits 100,000 K, the meltdown happens. Go to the bunker and be safe. The music is cool.
Ailen Invasion:
  The interstellar radio is a delicate piece of machinery. Activate it and there is a %50 chance that Earth will miss the signal, and it will be intercepted by ailens. Go to the helipad before the nukes go off. The music is kinda cool if you wait for a little while.
Help Recived:
  There is a %50 percent chance thet if the interstellar radio is activated, Earth will recive it. In that case, your core will be reset to perfect condition. Nothing else happens.
Core Collapse:
  Antimatter lasers maintain the core stability. If the stability ever hits %0, the core collapse happens. Evacuate to the rockets to escape. The music is cool.

Setup:
  Install pygame with `pip install pygame`, and if using the mac application, install jarco.text with `pip install jarco.text`. Replace the placeholders in event_music with the path to your music files.

Build:
  Install py2app with `pip install py2app`. If you have not already, install jarco.text with `pip install jarco.text`. Run `python /path/to/Black_Hole.py py2app` to build. It may give you an error about not being able to sign the app. Ignore it. Open Dist and open the app Black_Hole.

This is a Python program. Run the code in your favorite IDLE, or in the terminal. If using the mac application, run it and choose open if prompted. You may have to click on the icon in your Dock again to show the Pygame window.
